  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   * supports partition of >4 GB size
   * better supports NW/DR DOS 7 (AccMode)
   * supports partitions on ASPI media (like IOMEGA ZIP 100)
   * supports HPFS floppy
   * unmounts on changed media and removes from cache
   * DiskFree no longer alters high parts of ebx and edx
   * can coexist with Personal Netware
   * parses extended partition type 0f
   * files and volume label with spaces are now visible
   * can report 0 bytes free
   * can limit reported disk size to 2 GB


  new options:
  컴컴컴컴컴컴

   /0 ....... report zero bytes free, speeds up load process, because
              iHPFS does not have to scan all bitmap sectors

   /2 ....... reported disk size will fit into 31 bit integers,
              many programs have problems with bigger partitions

   /A ....... scan ASPI media for HPFS partitions

   /F ....... look for HPFS formated floppy



   recommended line in autoexec.bat:
   컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   LH C:\PATH\IHPFS.EXE /0 /2 /B1 /C=4000 /L



   i will try to maintain iHPFS.
